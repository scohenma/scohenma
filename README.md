##  About Me

Hi! I'm Sabrina Cohen, a third-year student at the University of Notre Dame, majoring in Business Analytics with minors in Finance and Computing & Digital Technologies. My academic and professional experiences have fostered my skills and interests in technology, analytics, and finance. I’m passionate about using these skills in my future endeavors to contribute to businesses and individuals in solving their everyday challenges.

This semester, my goals include regularly updating this profile, gaining more experience with Python and GitHub, and developing a well-polished portfolio to showcase to potential employers and recruiters. I am excited to work towards these objectives!

##  Current Projects
- **[Python Portfolio](https://github.com/scohenma/COHEN-Python_Portfolio)**: This portfolio highlights my work from my class Elements of Computing II, part of my Computing and Digital Technologies minor. It includes different projects I have worked on during the semester, as well as additional resources and material that have served as key part of my performance in class. This portfolio showcases my growth and success through many different hands-on projects. 
- **[University Explorer - Streamlit App](https://github.com/scohenma/COHEN-Python_Portfolio/tree/main/FinalStreamlitApp)**: This project reflects my interest in using technology to support educational access and informed decision-making. I developed the app using Streamlit to help high school students explore and compare mission-driven universities in a more personalized and visual way. I created a custom dataset of 10 institutions that share values I’ve experienced at Notre Dame, like academic excellence, community, and purpose. The app offers two interactive paths: one for students who need help narrowing down where to apply based on key factors like tuition and class size, and another for those looking to explore individual schools more deeply. It brings together data analysis, interface design, and a focus on user experience ,which are all areas I’m excited to keep growing in.
